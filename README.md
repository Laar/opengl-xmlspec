opengl-xmlspec
==============

Haskell datatypes and parser for the XML OpenGL specification.

Import Text.OpenGL for the most relevant stuff, or one of the specific modules
for a more controlled style.

Apart from the Haskell parser there is also a preprocessor to remove the
C-stype type declarations from the specification.
